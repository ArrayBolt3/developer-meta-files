===  DNS configuration Anonymity Linux Distribution Workstations ===

Whether a Anonymity Linux Distribution Gateway supports anonymized system DNS
for Workstation's traffic (also known as Transparent DNS Proxy) mainly depends
on the Gateway's firewall.

This package is simply installing /etc/resolv.conf which points to
10.152.152.10, where an Anon-Gateway is supposed to provide a DnsPort on port
53.

When you do not wish to use the Transparent DNS features, this package can be
removed.
=== /etc/resolv.conf.anondist ===

* [https://github.com/Whonix/anon-ws-dns-conf/blob/master/etc/resolv.conf.anondist /etc/resolv.conf.anondist]
* <code>~/Whonix/packages/anon-ws-dns-conf/etc/resolv.conf.anondist</code>

set <code>nameserver 10.152.152.10</code>
This works different in Qubes-Whonix.
