===  DNS configuration Anonymity Linux Distribution Gateways ===

Pointing /etc/resolv.conf to 127.0.0.1.

Whether a Anonymity Linux Distribution Gateway supports system DNS for its own
traffic in the clear or anonymized mainly depends on the Gateway's firewall.

Routing the workstation's system DNS through the anonymizer (also known as
Transparent DNS Proxy) or not is up to the Gateway's firewall as well.
