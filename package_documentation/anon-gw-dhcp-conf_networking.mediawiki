===  DHCP config for Anonymity Distribution Gateways ===

Prevents DHCP from modifications of /etc/resolv.conf by shipping a
configuration file.

In context of Anonymity Distribution Gateways, it is useful to obtain network
configuration for the interface to connect to the internet from a virtual
machine or hardware router to avoid usability issues with manual static
network configuration. At the same time, Anonymity Distribution Gateways
usually do not need a functional system DNS resolver (/etc/resolv.conf),
pointing to a clearnet DNS resolver, because ideally all the Gateway's traffic
including its own DNS is routed through the anonymity network as well.

Usually the Gateway's firewall should ensure, that the Gateway will not leak
it's own DNS requests. However, preventing DHCP from setting /etc/resolv.conf
to a functional clearnet DNS resolver is useful as defense in depth. Also in
case the Gateways system DNS resolver points to the anonymizer, it is crucial,
that it does not get modified by DHCP.
