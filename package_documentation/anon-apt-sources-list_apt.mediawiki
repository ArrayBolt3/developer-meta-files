Description: /etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.list for Anonymity Linux Distributions
===  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.list for Anonymity Linux Distributions ===

A question of distribution maintenance strategies. The more standard
way would indeed be populating /etc/apt/sources.list at install or build time
and leaving /etc/apt/sources.list.d alone. The idea of managing
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.list for the user is, the anonymity
distribution maintainers can decide when it is a better "change stable to
oldstable", "keep wheezy as long as needed to work out [eventual!] issues
that would break during upgrade to jessie" and such.

Debian APT repository sources.list

Configured to use <code>tor+https</code>.

Technical notes:
- Why is buster-updates disabled by default?
  See: https://wiki.debian.org/StableUpdates
- Why are sources (deb-src) disabled by default?
  Because those are not required by most users, to save time while
  running <code>sudo apt update</code>.
