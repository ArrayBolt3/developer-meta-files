===  Network Configuration for Whonix-Workstation ===

Includes /etc/network/interfaces for Whonix-Workstation.

Sets up an internal network interface eth0.

DNS configuration Anonymity Linux Distribution Workstations
Whether a Anonymity Linux Distribution Gateway supports anonymized system DNS
for Workstation's traffic (also known as Transparent DNS Proxy) mainly depends
on the Gateway's firewall.

This package is simply installing /etc/resolv.conf which points to
10.152.152.10, where an Anon-Gateway is supposed to provide a DnsPort on port
53. IP HARDCODED but no need to change because only description.

Currently relevant for Non-Qubes-Whonix only.
=== /etc/resolv.conf.whonix ===

* [https://github.com/Whonix/whonix-ws-network-conf/blob/master/etc/resolv.conf.whonix /etc/resolv.conf.whonix]
* <code>~/Whonix/packages/whonix-ws-network-conf/etc/resolv.conf.whonix</code>

set <code>nameserver 10.152.152.10</code>
This works different in Qubes-Whonix.
