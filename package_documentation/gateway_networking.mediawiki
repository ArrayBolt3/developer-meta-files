===  Tor Configuration and Tweaks for Anonymity Distributions ===

Tor config file with distribution defaults (for stream isolation, etc.),
example user configurations and other tweaks required. The Tor binary
itself does not get modified.

===  DHCP config for Anonymity Distribution Gateways ===

Prevents DHCP from modifications of /etc/resolv.conf by shipping a
configuration file.

In context of Anonymity Distribution Gateways, it is useful to obtain network
configuration for the interface to connect to the internet from a virtual
machine or hardware router to avoid usability issues with manual static
network configuration. At the same time, Anonymity Distribution Gateways
usually do not need a functional system DNS resolver (/etc/resolv.conf),
pointing to a clearnet DNS resolver, because ideally all the Gateway's traffic
including its own DNS is routed through the anonymity network as well.

Usually the Gateway's firewall should ensure, that the Gateway will not leak
it's own DNS requests. However, preventing DHCP from setting /etc/resolv.conf
to a functional clearnet DNS resolver is useful as defense in depth. Also in
case the Gateways system DNS resolver points to the anonymizer, it is crucial,
that it does not get modified by DHCP.

===  DNS configuration Anonymity Linux Distribution Gateways ===

Pointing /etc/resolv.conf to 127.0.0.1.

Whether a Anonymity Linux Distribution Gateway supports system DNS for its own
traffic in the clear or anonymized mainly depends on the Gateway's firewall.

Routing the workstation's system DNS through the anonymizer (also known as
Transparent DNS Proxy) or not is up to the Gateway's firewall as well.

===  Deactivates IPv4 forwarding using /etc/sysctl.d/ ===

IPv4 forwarding is not required for a Tor based Anonymity Distribution
Gateways. Deactivating it as defense in depth to prevent leaks.

For better security.
